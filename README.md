# CS499_Final_Project_ePortfolio
This repository houses my final project ePortfolio for the CS499 course, showcasing my growth and expertise in Computer Science. It includes enhanced artifacts demonstrating my skills in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases, alongside reflective narratives for each.


## Code Review Introduction

### Authentication Management System (Software Design and Engineering)
- **Overview**: A project initially developed for IT 145, focusing on secure login and role-based access controls for a zoo management application. It demonstrates my skills in transitioning from Java to C, implementing secure authentication mechanisms, and database integration.
- **Enhancements Objectives**: To enhance user registration, improve security features, and optimize the authentication process.
- **Initial Findings**: Opportunities for code optimization, database integration improvement, and security enhancements were identified. Plans include code refactoring for better maintainability and implementing advanced security measures for user data protection.

### Biding System (Algorithms and Data Structures)
- **Overview**: Demonstrates my proficiency with complex data structures and algorithms in managing and automating the bidding process efficiently, created for CS260.
- **Enhancements Objectives**: To optimize the algorithm for faster processing, improve data management, and enhance system scalability.
- **Initial Findings**: The need for algorithm efficiency improvement, particularly in sorting and searching functionalities. Plans involve algorithm optimization and more efficient data structures to manage large datasets effectively.

### Animal Shelter System (Databases)
- **Overview**: Developed for CS340, this project focuses on managing animal shelter data, utilizing Python, Dash, and Plotly for frontend interactivity, and MongoDB for backend operations.
- **Enhancements Objectives**: Expand functionalities for CRUD operations, advanced data analysis, geospatial visualization, and secure database queries.
- **Initial Findings**: Identified needs for database interaction enhancements, geospatial visualization, and query security. Enhancement plans include optimizing MongoDB queries, integrating advanced data analysis, and securing the application against unsafe user queries.

These sections outline the groundwork for a deep dive into each project's enhancements, reflecting my developmental journey and readiness for a professional career in computer science.
